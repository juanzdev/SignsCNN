TODO:
train the net with grayscale samples
test it
improve video detection green rectangle is behaving weird
get more training data



Recomendations:
background different from skin, avoid brownish or redish colors, 
When posing on the camera wear sleves
delete from training data complete arms with no sleeves
for the data generation, generate pics where hand detection appears with black on center(black bcakground) and full white hand (white background)
add, G word (tree fingers) (simbolo de perfecto), OK 
add, i word (me単ique) ok
add, o word , rosquita
add, v word , two fingers(simbolo paz)
add, w word , three fingers
add, y word , simbolo de groseria ( simbolo de amor)
add, j word , me単iquie de lado

el G se confunde con la C
el V esta medio bien
el Y no lo coge

G y C se confunden, pero G casi nunca se predice, parece que falta data de G(6640)

PARECE QUE HAY EXPLODING GRADIENTS... FALTA REGULARIZAR?

CNN 1 
detecta bien aveces
tiene un problema parece ser de ruido especifico por el masking(el masking varia mucho)
problemas de luz(debido al masking) se acentuan mucho, esto impacta la inferencia
depende del hand detection, el hand detection no es tan preciso, mu単ecas y brazos se detectan y requeriria mas training. La cara la incluye, esto afecta la inferencia.(skin detection) 
enproduccion, debemos aplicar el masking y  el hand detection
ESPERAR A VER COMO VA CON DROPOUT
SI NO ... ENTRENAR POR MAS TIEMPO...
